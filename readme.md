# Interactive Shape Drawer

Welcome to the Interactive Shape Drawer! This web application allows you to create various shapes, including rectangles, circles, triangles, polygons, and organic shapes. You can customize the color, position, and dimensions of each shape you draw.

## Features

- **Shape Selection**: Choose from different shapes (rectangle, circle, triangle, polygon, organic) to draw.
- **Color Picker**: Select any color using the color picker to customize your shapes.
- **Position Input**: Specify the X and Y coordinates for placing your shapes on the canvas.
- **Dynamic Inputs**: The application dynamically displays input fields based on the selected shape type, allowing you to specify the dimensions.
- **Organic Shape Drawing**: Enter control points to create organic shapes.
- **3D Effect**: Optionally apply a 3D effect to the organic shapes using color gradients for depth.
- **Image Upload**: Upload images to create organic shapes from pictures (not currently implemented in this version).
  
## Getting Started

To run the Interactive Shape Drawer , follow these steps:

## Usage
Select a shape from the dropdown menu.
Choose a color for the shape.
Input the position (X and Y coordinates) where you want the shape to be drawn.
Enter additional parameters (like width, height, radius, or control points) based on the selected shape.
Click on the "Draw Shape" button to create the shape on the canvas.

**Creating Organic Shapes**:

Manual Control Points:
Select "Organic" from the shape dropdown.
Enter control points in the format x1,y1 x2,y2 x3,y3 .... For example, 100,150 200,100 250,200 will create a shape based on these coordinates.
Note: Control points can be added by clicking and dragging points on the canvas for dynamic shape adjustments.
